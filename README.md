- 10/10: "I don't care, I just like them because they're salty." -Papa Fong
- 8/10: "I like them because they change the oil. They put way too much salt but they are not burnt. They're super good because you can really taste the frozen potato." -Momma Fong

- 6/10: "They're not the best fries because they're not crunchy and they get soggy fast. You pay a lot of money for like 15 fries." -Baby Fong

- 7/10: "Well curly fries they're good but they don't change the oil so you can taste the old oil. They're not seasoned very well but they're crunch and fun to pull apart." -Momma Fong
- 9/10: "Arby's curly fries are good. Really good but really bad for you." -Baby Fong

- 7/10: "I like the sea salt and big fries but they're just okay." -Papa Fong
- 7/10: "The big ones aren't as good as the little ones because they're not as crunchy. If you talk to your friends instead of eating them, they get soggy really fast. The price is pretty good though." -Baby Fong
